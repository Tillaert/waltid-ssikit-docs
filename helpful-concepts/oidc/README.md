# OpenID Connect (OIDC)

Below you find **sequence diagrams**, for the issuance and verification flows.

Examples of using the **SSIKit command line interface** to interact with OIDC issuers and verifiers, can be found in the [**OIDC usage examples**](../../usage-examples/data-exchange-protocols/oidc/README.md)**.**
