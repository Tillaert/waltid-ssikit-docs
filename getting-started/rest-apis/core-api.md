# Core API

The _Core API_ exposes wallet core functionality in the scope of storing and managing

* cryptographic keys,
* Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs),
* Verifiable Credentials (VCs).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Core API exposes most of the funtionalities provided by the SSI Kit, however newer features will only be released in the other API endpoints. Therefore, it is recommended to use the Signatory API, Custodian API and Auditor API for most use cases.
