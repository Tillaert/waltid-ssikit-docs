# Developer Relations

We are believers in open source and we know that we cannot change the world by ourselves. We also believe that Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) should be a commodity that is available to everyone for free, because only then can SSI truly change the world.

## Where can I find information about development plans?
We decided to make our product development process public so that anyone can know
- what we are building and influence our roadmap
- how we are building things and contribute to an open source SSI stack for everyone.
- There are two places where you can find everything you need to know about our product development planning:

### The "Roadmap"

The Roadmap shows all key releases to give a functional perspective on our development plans. You can see when new products or features will be launched and why we are launching them (every issue begins with a description of the value created for users).

| __Purpose__ | Communicate goals and product plans publicly so that potentially anyone can influence and contribute. |
| ------------- |-------------|
| __Target Audience__ | Anyone (developers, managers, business analysts, researchers). |
| __Perspective__ | High-level and functional (incl. key releases and benefits). |
| __Timeframe__ | Shows plans for the next 3-4 months. | 
| __Update Cycle__ | Weekly (minor changes) and/or monthly (significant changes). |
| __Location__ | [GitHub]*(soon published)* |

### The "Dev Board"

The Dev Board shows daily tasks of our developers and third-party contributors to give a detailed and technical perspective on our product development plans. You can see exactly what is being worked on at a granular level.

Important facts at a glance:

| __Purpose__ | Coordinate the daily work of developers (technical implementations). |
| ------------- |-------------|
| __Target Audience__ | Developers and technologists. |
| __Perspective__ | Detailed and technical (GitHub issues / individual tasks). |
| __Timeframe__ | Shows plans for the next 2-4 months. | 
| __Update Cycle__ | Daily. |
| __Location__ | [GitHub] *(soon published)*|


## How can I influence the Roadmap?

We want to create as much value as possible for people and organisations who want to use SSI. This is why everyone who implements the open source solutions we publish can actively influence the roadmap by sharing their requirements and needs with us.
In addition, anyone else can reach out to us with ideas for new products or features, which will be evaluated against the needs and requirements of actual implementers.

How you can influence the Roadmap:

- Implementers: Our customers' success and product teams are in constant contact with implementers to source feedback and ensure that their needs and requirements are considered in the Roadmap.
- Non-Implementers: If you are a developer, researcher, consultant (etc.) who is not (yet) implementing the open source solutions published by us, your ideas can still find their way on our Roadmap.

## How can I contribute?

Everyone with a sufficient level of required expertise can contribute to the code base. Typically contributors are developers and/or organisations that already implement the open source solutions we publish.
