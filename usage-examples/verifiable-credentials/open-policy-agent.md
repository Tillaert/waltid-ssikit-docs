# Open Policy Agent

The Open Policy Agent ([https://www.openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org)) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across. OPA provides a high-level declarative language called [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#rego) that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software.

The following graphic illustrates the technical architecture how a custom application can verify credentials by utilizing the Open Policy Agent.
