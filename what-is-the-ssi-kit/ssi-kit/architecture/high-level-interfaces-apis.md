# High-Level Interfaces / APIs

The SSI Kit exposes high-level interfaces / APIs to hide the complex introduced by

* low-level services (e.g. key management, signing, data storage)
* different ecosystems (i.e. different SSI flavours, business logic and governance frameworks).

You can simply call the same generic and robust interfaces even if new low-level services or ecosystems are added / required.
