# Data Exchange Protocols

Authentication and data exchange protocols (e.g. OIDC/SIOP) enable the exchange of data (VCs) between different parties.

The SSI Kit supports latest OpenID Connect extension for SSI:

* OpenID Connect for Credential Issuance (OIDC4CI)
* OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP)

You can learn more about protocols [here](../../../ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts/).
