# Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) establish a public key infrastructure by linking keys to unique identifiers that allow different parties to find and interact with each other.

The SSI Kit supports:

* did:ebsi
* did:web
* did:key

_Note that we are continuously adding support for new DID methods._

You can find more about DIDs [here](../../what-is-ssi/technologies-and-concepts.md).
