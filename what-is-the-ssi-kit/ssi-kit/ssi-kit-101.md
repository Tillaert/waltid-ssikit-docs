# SSI Kit 101

## TL;DR

The SSI Kit offers an **everything developers and organizations need to use Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) with ease.**&#x20;

Here are the most important things to know about the SSI Kit:

* It is fully **open source (Apache 2).** You can use the code for free and without strings attached. &#x20;
* It is a holistic solution that allows you to **build** **use cases “end-to-end”.** There is no need to research, combine or tweak different libraries to build pilots or production systems.
* It **abstracts complexity** via different interfaces (CLI, APIs). Apart from the abstracted core infrastructure which enables low-level functionality (e.g. key handling, data storage, signing), additional services **facilitate development and integration** (e.g. Issuer and Verifier Portals).
* It is **modular, composable and built on open standards** allowing you to individualize and extend functionality with your own or third party implementations. This openness **** prevents lock-in and enables you to build solutions that meet your requirements without compromise.&#x20;
* It is **flexible** in a sense that you can deploy and run it on-premise, in your (multi) cloud environment or as a library in your application.&#x20;
* It enables you to **use different identity ecosystems** like Europe’s emerging identity ecosystem ([EBSI, ESSIF](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/ebsi)) in anticipation of a multi-ecosystem future.

## What is the SSI Kit?

The SSI Kit is a set of libraries that you can use to establish an SSI infrastructure layer to power complex, low-level operations for potentially any use case in any industry.

In short, it enables all functionality required to use SSI:

* Interactions with Registries regardless of the underlying technology (e.g. blockchains, DNS).
* Use of keys and Decentralised Identifiers (e.g. generation, signing, anchoring, resolution, lifecycle management).
* Use of Verifiable Credentials/Presentations (e.g. singing, issuance, verification, lifecycle management).
* Use of authentication and data exchange protocols (e.g. OIDC/SIOP).
