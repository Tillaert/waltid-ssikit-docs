# SSI 101

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a user-centric approach to digital identity that **gives people and organizations full control over their data**. As a result, SSI enables anyone to easily share their data and reliably prove their identity (i.e. who they are and anything about them) without sacrificing security or privacy.&#x20;

In other words, SSI enables you to “**bring your own identity**” and this is true for potentially any type of information  - from your core identity (e.g. name, age, address) to your education and work records, your health and insurance data, bank account and financial information, etc.

Moreover, SSI can be used to model the **digital identities of people,** **organizations** and **things**.

At the end of the day, SSI promises a digital world in which interactions are effortless and worry-free. It is **simply the next evolutionary step** in identity management, a new paradigm in which our digital identities are no longer fragmented and locked into silos that are under someone else’s control, but only at our own disposal to be shared securely and privately.
