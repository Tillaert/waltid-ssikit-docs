# Introduction

The **SSI Kit** is a technology stack for enabling Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in any application. All components are written in Kotlin/Java and can directly be tied in JVM-based applications. Alternatively all functions can be accesses over the RESTfull webservice interface, making integration with other languages and deployment scenarios straigtforward.

## About the documentation

The goal of this documentation is to help you (better) understand

* Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and how it works;
* our open source products, how they work and how to use them.

The documentation is continuously reviewed and updated by the team to reflect the latest changes and updates to our tech stack. If you find any errors or inconsistencies, please let us know, we value your opinion!
