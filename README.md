# Introduction

This documentation will help you understand how the _SSI Kit_ works and how you can use it. However, it presumes a certain level of knowledge about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) so

* if you are already familiar with SSI, you can jump to the [introduction of the SSI Kit](ssi-kit/ssi-kit/).&#x20;
* if you are new to SSI, please continue with our [introduction to Self-Sovereign Identity](ssi-kit/what-is-ssi/).
